DESCRIPTION:
    This program demonstrates populates data from CSV file into network of nodes correctly.
    Support adding a new data value to the network, given (key, value) via any active node.
    Add must be efficient, make use of predecessor, successor, and finger tables as 
    appropriate using key SHA1 hash and recursive RPC.

    chord_populate takes a port number of an existing node and the filename of the data file.

USAGE:
    python3 chord_populate.py

    Read a csv file. https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
